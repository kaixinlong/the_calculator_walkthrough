# The Calculator Walkthrough
An exercise in programming to help hone your skills through practice and repetition.
This notebook is a complete walkthrough with notes and explanations. It can be used as a reference, a study guide and provide one possible answer that you can use to compare with your attempt. This notebook is too long to be a [CodeKatas](http://codekata.com/) but aspires to similar principles. 

## CodeKata Principles

With CodeKatas, you are trying to solve a problem and follow the best practices of the programming language.   There are no right or wrong answers. The benefit comes from the process, not from the result. See [Awesome Katas] for a curated list of CodeKatas see [Awesome Katas](https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas). For Python CodeKatas see [here](https://github.com/clair3st/code-katas).

## What are *our* Best Practices

Here are the best practices we have been applying throughout the course.

1. Create a code repository (*GitHub, small frequent commits*)
2. Follow style guidelines (*PEP8*)
3. Correct broken code immediately (*exception handling, input validation, testing*)
4. Use the PyPI instead of doing it yourself (*import module*)
5. Use the Right Data Types and Structures (*int, float, list, etc. *)
6. Write Readable Code (*meaningful names and comments*)
7. Create readable documentation (*Docstrings*)
8. Use Virtual Environments (*Google VM instance, Binder*)
9. Avoid anti-patterns (*be specific imports, exceptions etc. *)
10. Follow *Zen of Python* (try *import this*)

## How to use this notebook

You should copy the notebook, delete all the cells except for *The Challenge - Simple Calculator* and then attempt to solve the problem by applying the best practices above.
