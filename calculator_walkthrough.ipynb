The benefit comes from the process, not from the result. See [Awesome Katas] for a curated list of CodeKatas see [Awesome Katas](https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas).

        "6. Write Readable Code (*meaningful names and comments*)\n",
        "7. Create readable documentation (*Docstrings*)\n",
        "8. Use Virtual Environments (*Google VM instance, Binder*)\n",
        "9. Avoid anti-patterns (*be specific imports, exceptions etc. *)\n",
