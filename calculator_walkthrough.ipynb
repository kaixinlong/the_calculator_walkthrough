It can be used as a reference, a study guide and provide one possible answer that you can use to compare with your attempt. This notebook is too long to be a [CodeKatas](http://codekata.com/) but aspires to similar principles. \n",

The benefit comes from the process, not from the result. See [Awesome Katas] for a curated list of CodeKatas see [Awesome Katas](https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas).

        "5. Use the Right Data Types and Structures (*int, float, list, etc. *)\n",
        "6. Write Readable Code (*meaningful names and comments*)\n",
        "7. Create readable documentation (*Docstrings*)\n",
        "8. Use Virtual Environments (*Google VM instance, Binder*)\n",
        "9. Avoid anti-patterns (*be specific imports, exceptions etc. *)\n",
