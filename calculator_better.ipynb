        "\n",
        "This design and implementation is also a possible next version from the initial design in the notebook [Calculator - Good Design](https://github.com/michael-borck/the_calculator_walkthrough/blob/main/calculator_good.ipynb), or perhaps this design is the starting point from the earlier stages in our methodology.\n",

        "1. Use a code repository (*GitHub, small frequent commits*)\n",
        "2. Follow style guidelines (*PEP8*)\n",
        "3. Correct broken code immediately (*exception handling, input validation, testing*)\n",
        "4. Use the PyPI instead of doing it yourself (*search and import module*)\n",
        "5. Use the Right Data Types and Structures (*int, float, list, etc. *)\n",
        "6. Write Readable Code (*meaningful names and comments*)\n",
        "7. Create readable documentation (*Docstrings*)\n",
        "8. Use Virtual Environments (*Google VM instance, Binder*)\n",
        "9. Avoid anti-patterns (*be specific imports, exceptions etc. *)\n",
        "10. Follow *Zen of Python* (try *import this*)\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Challenge - Simple Calculator\n",
        "\n",
        "Write a program to prompt the user to select a mathematical operation and input two numbers. The program will then operate on the two numbers and output the result. The user will be able to continue performing operations on numbers or exit the program. The arithmetic operations include: \n",
